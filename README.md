# ðŸ“¡ Satellite Signal Strength Prediction  
### A Supervised Regression Project for Predicting Signal Quality Based on Weather Conditions

---

##  Overview

This project develops machine learning models to predict **satellite signal strength (in dBm)** based on weather conditions and atmospheric factors. It follows a structured learning path:

- **Simple Linear Regression** â€“ using one feature (rain rate)
- **Multiple Regression** â€“ incorporating multiple weather features
- **Non-linear Models** â€“ Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Advanced Optimization** â€“ feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning

###  Business Relevance

Accurate predictions can help satellite internet providers:

- Manage service quality during adverse weather
- Proactively notify customers of potential disruptions
- Optimize transmission power and resource allocation

---

##  Technical Goals

- Collect weather data from public APIs
- Simulate satellite signal degradation using physics-inspired models
- Build and evaluate multiple regression algorithms
- Identify key weather factors affecting signal strength
- Create a reproducible, well-documented pipeline for portfolio demonstration

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Languages & Libraries**: `Python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `xgboost`, `shap`, `requests`
- **APIs**: `OpenWeatherMap` (free tier)
- **Tools**: `Jupyter Notebook`, `PyCharm`, `Git`
